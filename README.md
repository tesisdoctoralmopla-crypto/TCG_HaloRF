# Experimental Proposal for the Detection of the Hidden Modulus: A Decisive Test for the Constitutive Theory of Gravity

## Abstract
The Constitutive Theory of Gravity (TCG) proposes a self-tuning mechanism that resolves the $10^{123}$-order-of-magnitude discrepancy between the quantum vacuum energy density and the observed cosmological constant. This mechanism predicts the existence of a remnant scalar field, the Hidden Modulus $\phi_{T_{1}}$, with an ultralight mass $m_{\phi T}\sim4\times10^{-7}$ eV and a dark matter portal coupling $\lambda_{DM}\sim10^{-51}$. We present the design of a Radio Frequency (RF) resonant haloscope optimized for $f_{\phi_{T}}\approx96.7$ MHz, capable of detecting the electromagnetic signal induced by $\phi_{T}$. We quantitatively derive the predicted signal power $P_{sig}^{TCG}\sim10^{-22}$ W and the required experimental parameters, establishing a clear protocol to confirm or refute TCG through a short-term search campaign.

## I. INTRODUCTION
The Constitutive Theory of Gravity (TCG) posits that the quantum vacuum energy density $\rho_{vac}^{(QFT)}\sim M_{P1}^{4}$ is modulated by the Universal Constitutive Modulus $K_{g}$, which acts as a dynamic vacuum filter, resolving the cosmological constant crisis through a self-tuning mechanism. The theory's unavoidable prediction is a residual scalar field, the Hidden Modulus $\phi_{T}$ whose oscillation frequency lies in the radio frequency (RF) range, making it accessible to current experimental techniques.

The predicted signal power is:
$$P_{sig}^{TCG}\approx1\times10^{-22}W$$
achievable with an integration time of $t\sim1.3$ h for a signal-to-noise ratio $SNR=5$.

## II. THEORETICAL PREDICTION
The Hidden Modulus $\phi_{T}$ obeys the hierarchy relation:
$$
\frac{m_{\phi_{T}}}{\alpha_{\phi_{T}}}\sim5.6\times10^{14}eV
$$
where $m_{\phi_{T}}\approx4\times10^{-7}$ eV. This corresponds to a coherent oscillation frequency of:
$$
f_{\phi_{T}} = 96.7 \text{ MHz}
$$

## III. DERIVATION OF SIGNAL POWER
The portal coupling to dark matter is given by:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{int}^{TCG}=-\frac{\lambda_{DM}}{M_{Pl}}\phi_{T}\chi^{2}
$$
with $\lambda_{DM}\sim10^{-51}$ determined by the cosmological constant cancellation condition.

The power generated in a resonant haloscope is:
$$
P_{sig}\propto g_{\phi\gamma}^{2}\frac{\rho_{\phi}B_{0}^{2}V_{eff}CQ}{\omega_{\phi}}
$$
where $g_{\phi\gamma}^{TCG}$ is the effective coupling between $\phi_{T}$ and the electromagnetic signal.

## IV. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
We propose an RF Resonance Haloscope with a lumped-element resonator or a metamaterial array, optimized for $f_{\phi_{T}}=96.7$ MHz. Quantum amplification using JPA or SQUID at~10-100 mK will be included to reach the quantum noise limit $hf_{0}/2$.

### RF Haloscope Design Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Search frequency $f_{0}$ | 96.7 MHz | TCG Prediction |
| Effective volume $V_{eff}$ | 1 m³ | Effective coupling |
| Quality Factor Q | $10^{4}$ | Superconducting resonator |
| System Temperature $T_{sys}$ | $\le1~K$ | Minimize thermal noise |

## V. FALSIFIABILITY AND ROADMAP
The experiment provides a clear verdict:
* **Confirmation:** A coherent peak at $f_{\phi_{T}}$ with $P_{sig}\sim 10^{-22}$ W validates TCG and the Constitutive Modulus $K_{g}$.
* **Refutation:** Non-detection at the required sensitivity would falsify the TCG prediction.

## VI. CONCLUSION
This proposal represents a definitive fire test for the TCG. The combination of a quantitative prediction and a feasible experimental design ensures that the theory can be conclusively confirmed or refuted using a short-term RF haloscope campaign.
